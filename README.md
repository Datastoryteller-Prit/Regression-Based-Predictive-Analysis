## 🧠 Methodology

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed in-depth data exploration to understand feature distributions, correlations, and trends.
- Identified potential predictors and outliers using visualization and statistical summaries.

### 📈 Predictive Modeling
- Built a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to capture relationships between variables influencing Blinkit’s revenue.
- Evaluated model assumptions through residual plots and statistical diagnostics.

### 🧪 Diagnostic Checks
Applied a suite of diagnostic tools to validate model reliability:

- **PRESS Residuals**
- **Box-Cox Transformation**
- **Cook’s Distance**
- **DFFITS**
- **Confidence Intervals** for coefficients

### 🧩 Handling Multicollinearity
To address multicollinearity and improve generalization:

- Applied **Lasso** and **Ridge** Regression (L1 & L2 Regularization)
- Conducted **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction

Achieved a final **Adjusted R² of 0.74**, indicating a strong model fit.
